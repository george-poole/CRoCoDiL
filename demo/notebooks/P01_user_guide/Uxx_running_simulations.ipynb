    "### Running a simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In an iPython notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "For small-scale testing and prototyping, it can be beneficial to run the simulation in an interactive environment and have the simulation data available in memory for immediate visualization or further computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# file `dns_specific.ipynb` in same directory as `dns_specific.py`\n",
    "from lucifex.sim import integrate\n",
    "from dns_specific import dns_specific\n",
    "\n",
    "simulation = dns_specific(\n",
    "    # arguments overriding the simulation's default I/O and low-level behaviour\n",
    ")(\n",
    "    # arguments for the domain, boundary conditions, etc.\n",
    ")\n",
    "run(\n",
    "    simulation,\n",
    "    # arguments for the time loop\n",

    "In particular, the `store_delta` argument determines the interval size, in either number of integration steps if of type `int` or simulation time if of type `float`, at which to keep simulation data in memory. If `None`, no simulation data is kept in memory. If unspecified in the command line, `store_delta` will assume its value configured in the `configure_simulation` decorator function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "For long-running simulations and batches of simulations, it is best to run from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "`python dns_specific.py --help` will list all argument names and default values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The complete set of command-line arguments consists of those passed to `configure_simulation` to override the simulation's default I/O and compiler options, those passed to `dns_specific` which are required for the domain, constitutive relations, boundary conditions and initial conditions, and those passed to `run` for the time loop. In particular, the `write_delta` argument is much like the `store_delta` except that it determined the interval size at which to write simulation data to file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a simulation with the argument `X` set to $X=X_0$ and `Y` set to $Y=Y_0$\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "To run multiple simulations in parallel, the GNU command line utility `parallel` is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run `N_PROC` simultaneous processes with the arguments `X` and `Y` taking values $(X, Y)\\in\\{(X_0, Y_0), (X_0, Y_1), (X_1, Y_0), (X_1, Y_1)\\}$\n",

    "Further command line utilities:\n",
    "* `caffeinate` e.g. `caffeinate -d -i -s -t <SECONDS> <COMMAND>` to prevent sleeping\n",
    "* `nohup` e.g. `nohup <COMMAND> & disown` to run without interruption\n",
    "* `htop` and `kill` for process mangement\n",
    "* (Ctrl + Z) followed by `bg` to move process to background <br>\n",

    "### Postprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the core functionality provided by the `lucifex.io` and `lucifex.viz` modules, CRoCoDiL contains the `crocodil.post` module for postprocessing utilties such as computing contours and plume statistics calculations."
