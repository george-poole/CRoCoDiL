# How to create a convection-reaction system in CRoCoDiL

User-defined constitutive relations, boundary conditions and initial conditions may be prescribed to investigate novel models in CRoCoDiL. Solutal or thermal transport may be 'switched off' by setting the solutal or thermal dispersion relation to `None`. Porosity evolution may be 'switched off' by setting the evolution number to `None`, or equivalently $\varepsilon=0$.
